Since 2021, in EU its mandatory to sell product with the VAT of the shipping country.

As a consequence some customers are expecting to have a single included tax price for example 120€TaxIncluded for all the countries.
PS don't support included tax as a cross country cross website reference for product price. So it's not possible in Ps to have a fixed price set with included vat and compute excluded tax price for each product and each country. As a consequence PS won't be able to compute a 100€w/oTax for france , 99€w/oTax for belgium etc...
Yet Odoo is able to do this thanks to fiscal positions and included VAT setup.
With this module, you can choose if Odoo is the master of the tax computation
