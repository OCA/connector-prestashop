Prestashop (http://www.prestashop.com/) is a popular e-commerce plateform
written in PHP/MySQL and published under the Open Software licence v3.0.

This module allows the synchronisation of the following objects between OpenERP
and Prestashop :
- shop groups and shops
- currencies
- languages
- countries
- carriers
- products

Once these objects are synchronised, it will allow the import of orders,
together with the related customers and addresses.

This connector supports Prestashop 1.5 and uses the webservices of Prestashop ;
it doesn't require any plug-in in Prestashop.

This connector was started by Akretion (http://www.akretion.com/) and
Camptocamp(http://www.camptocamp.com/) during a code sprint that took place in
Seythenex(Haute-Savoie, France) on 6-10 February 2012. Publishing this
connector as free software was possible thanks to a large R&D effort of
Akretion and Camptocamp (with some help of Julius Network Solutions). Akretion
and Camptocamp form the "PrestashopERPconnect Core Editors".

This connector is built on a very solid basis, but still requires deep
knowledge of both OpenERP, Prestashop and the connector's internals to be
deployed successfully in production. The PrestashopERPconnect Core Editors are
available to help you deploy this solution for your Prestashop-based e-commerce
business.
